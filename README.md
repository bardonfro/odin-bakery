## Cookies
I chose cookies because I really like cookies. What more need I say?

## Pages
I am loving webpack and all of its capabilities, but it definitely confuses some things. Github pages becomes a chore. I cheated by putting my build in /docs. I know this is very bad form, but for this project it is the simplest way of getting it there.
